# Deferred work

Work deliberately left for later. Each entry names what was deferred, where the
code lives, and the concrete trigger that makes it due. When a trigger lands,
do the work and delete the entry.

## Animation decision log depth

- **What:** the runtime plan (`docs/plans/animation-runtime.md`, decision
  history) asks for a global cvar setting the decision log's ring depth.
- **Where:** `AnimDecisionLog` in `engine/include/anim/AnimDecisionLog.h` is a
  component with a fixed 64-record ring (`kAnimDecisionLogCapacity`). A
  runtime depth needs the records out of relocatable component storage, into a
  registry-owned ring addressed from the component.
- **Trigger:** a trace exported with `anim.trace.export` that reports
  overwritten records the investigation needed, or a consumer that wants a log
  on many entities at once and cannot afford 64 records each.

## Default decision log on character entities in dev builds

- **What:** the runtime plan says dev builds keep a short decision log on every
  Character-tier entity. Today a log is added by content, by the editor
  preview, or by `anim.trace <entity>`.
- **Where:** tiers are presets in the animation editor
  (`editor/animation_editor/src/authoring/AnimationRigRecipe.h`), not a runtime
  property, so the runtime has nothing to key the default on.
- **Trigger:** the rig or scene format gaining a declared per-entity diagnostic
  setting, or the decision-log depth work above, which settles how a short ring
  is stored.
